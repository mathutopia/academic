abstract = "As a promising technology, blockchain overcomes many shortages in traditional areas. However, the low efficiency prevents it from being widely used in practice. Through analyzing the transaction history in blockchain, we found that the account usage frequency is highly heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a new account structure to improve the efficiency. The preliminary experiments show that the proposed structure has obvious advantages in efficiency compared with other account structures."
