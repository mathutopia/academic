With the advancements in Internet technologies and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), a new era of the Internet of Things (IoT) is being realized. IoT produces a lot of information which can be used to improve the efficiency of our daily lives and provides advanced services in a wide range of application domains. However, the privacy and the data fusing problems remain major challenges, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks and the amount of data collected from IoT increasing at an exponential rate. Thus, a privacy-protected and inter-cloud data fusing platform is needed to the demand for data mining and analytic activities in IoT. In this paper, we propose such a platform based on JointCloud Blockchain and study a novel case of smart traveling based on the proposed platform.
