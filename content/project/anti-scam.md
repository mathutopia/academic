This project focused on anti-scams in blockchain. The first scam is the classic Ponzi scheme. We have published a paper on detecting smart Ponzi schemes (a new kinds of Ponzi scheme implemeted with smart contract) on Ethereum platform in the World Wild Web Conference (WWW2018). Now, we are trying to improve the results and challenging other types of scams.
